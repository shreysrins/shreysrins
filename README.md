### Welcome to my profile!

My name is Shreyas and I am a junior at MIT studying math and computer science. I'll be completing my undergrad this spring, with plans to pursue a Master of Finance at MIT Sloan starting in the fall. My career interests are in quantitative finance and trading, and I'm also interested in academic finance research.
